Member: My date of birth is March 12, 1985, and I'm looking to get pre-authorization for a knee replacement surgery.

PA Agent: Okay, thank you for providing that information, Emily. Can you please tell me a little bit more about the procedure and why it's needed?

Member: Sure. I've been experiencing chronic knee pain for several years and my doctor has recommended a knee replacement surgery to alleviate the pain and improve my mobility.

PA Agent: I understand. Can you please provide me with your doctor's name and contact information so I can verify the details?

Member: My doctor's name is Dr. John Smith and his office number is 555-1234.

PA Agent: Yes, of course. Based on your plan, you will be responsible for a $500 copayment and 20% coinsurance for the procedure.

PA Agent: I apologize, but I don't have a specific timeframe for when we'll be able to make a decision. We'll be in touch with you once we receive the additional information from your doctor.

Member: (angrily) This is ridiculous. I'm going to have to call back next week to follow up on this, aren't I?

PA Agent: (calmly) Yes, Ms. Wilson, it's likely that we'll need to follow up on this case next week. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Member: (angrily) Inconvenience? You have no idea... (hangs up the phone)

PA Agent: (to herself) Well, that was a difficult call...","Follow-up action is needed in this case. The pre-authorization for the surgery was not completed during the call, and the PA Agent mentioned that additional information from the member's doctor is required before a decision can be made. The member was frustrated and indicated that she may need to follow up next week. It would be best to ensure that the necessary information is obtained from the doctor and that the member is contacted promptly with an update on the pre-authorization status.",follow-up action needed,neutral
